# TapSvgGestureHandler

This project tries to fix an issue present in later versions of gesturehandler and svg packages that didnt allow the <G> component to have a onpress event.

The fix of this bug was achieved with the following versions of aforementioned packages:

    "react-native": "0.68.2",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.4.2",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^2.8.0",
    "react-native-svg": "^12.3.0"

Peace
